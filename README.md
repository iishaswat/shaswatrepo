# Token Contract (Solidity)

This contract is a basic implementation of an ERC20-like token written in Solidity. It allows for the creation, transfer, and destruction of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Token Details**:
  - `coinName`: The name of the token (e.g., "shaswat").
  - `coinSymbol`: The symbol of the token (e.g., "SST").
  - `circulatingSupply`: Tracks the total supply of tokens in circulation.

- **Token Balances**:
  - `accountBalances`: A mapping that stores the token balances of Ethereum addresses.

- **Functions**:
  - `issueTokens`: Allows minting (creating) tokens and assigning them to a specified address.
  - `destroyTokens`: Allows burning (destroying) tokens from a specified address.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with this contract, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Solidity Development Environment: Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up with a compatible version of the Solidity compiler (e.g., >=0.8.0).
- Ethereum Network: Choose an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ganache, Ropsten, Mainnet) to deploy the contract.

### Deployment

1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Use Remix IDE, Truffle, Hardhat, or similar tools to deploy the `Token` contract to your chosen Ethereum network.
   - Verify and record the deployed contract address for interactions.

### Interacting with the Contract

1. **Using Ethereum Wallets**:
   - Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the deployed contract address.
   - **Mint Tokens**: Call the `issueTokens` function to mint new tokens and assign them to an address.
   - **Burn Tokens**: Call the `destroyTokens` function to burn tokens from an address.

2. **Using Scripts**:
   - Write scripts using web3.js, ethers.js, or similar libraries to interact programmatically with the deployed contract.
